## WARNING!!! 
### Working with lasers can be dangerous.  Wear proper protection. 
### Using high power lasers to engrave or cut will create smoke and fumes. Use in a well ventilated area.

This is a guide to attaching the Creality (or Comgrow) laser head kit to the Robo 3D R1.  The laser head was designed to be able to quicky be mounted and removed via the magnets on it.  The R1 does not have a place to quickly mount this laser head kit.  What I have done is remove the extruder assembly from the printer and replace it with a laser module.

The laser module can be purchased here (affiliate link, would appreciate ordering from this link especially if you found this guide helpful).

Before removing your extruder, make sure you are able to print this mount for the laser module: https://github.com/mak0t0san/Robo3D-Laser/blob/main/3D%20Models/Robo3D%20Laser%20Mount.stl
